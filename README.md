# NStrings for C++!

## What is this repo for?
This repo aims to add some niche functions to strings with in C++. I started doing this when I inntially made the `sheer();` function and started talking about it with friends. I was soon told that what I was aiming to do was fairly usefull. So here I am, throwing this out to the world hoping that someone beyond me sees value in this project.

## Why is the documentation awfull?
Because I'm awfull with documenting my work ðŸ˜­. Realistically I intended to true and keep accurate documentation as I expand this project so I am very aware that for the mean time the documentation will be lacking to say the least until maybe the first publication which will be whenerver I feel this project reaches a decent pre-alpha stage.
